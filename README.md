# MagicSquaresAndSudoku
This repository contains code for Magic Squares and Sudoku course

This course explains how to create two-dimensional sudoku puzzles from four-dimensional magic cubes.

A FREE video course that explains theory of magic squares and sudoku puzzles is available at:

As far as I know, the theory,  and mathematics, for these algorithms has not been published anywhere else.

The algorithms enable you to create sudoku puzzles that are larger than "newspaper size puzzles".  For example, 25 by 25,  49 by 49, 81 by 81, and so forth. 

Have fun building magic squares and sudoku puzzles!
